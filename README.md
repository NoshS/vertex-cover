# vertex-cover

Console based program. To run: python greedy_vc.py

You will then be prompted to enter a value for k. This program already has a graph defined inside of it so you donâ€™t need to input a graph,(you can change the graph located near the bottom of the source file if needed).  The program will then output the vertex cover if it satisfies the condition that the vertex cover is <= k, otherwise it will print an alternative message.
